# Shortest Path Finder

🚀 This Python project is a shortest path finder that utilizes the Breadth-first search algorithm.

## How it Works

The Shortest Path Finder uses the Breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. 🧭 It explores all the neighboring nodes at the current level before moving on to the next level. This ensures that the shortest path is found efficiently. ⚡️

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `shortest_path_finder.py` script.
3. The program will display the shortest path between the two nodes.

Feel free to customize the graph and explore different scenarios! 🎯
